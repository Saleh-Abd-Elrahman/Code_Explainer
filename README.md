## Sample Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets you can use to test the application:

### JavaScript (React Component)

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher({ url, render }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true);
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  return render(data);
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

### Python (Sorting Algorithm)

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```

### Java (Design Pattern)

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private String data;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes
        data = "Initial data";
    }
    
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    public String getData() {
        return data;
    }
    
    public void setData(String data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
}
```

## Testing

This application has been designed with testability in mind. Here's how to test various aspects:

### Testing Strategy and Implementation

Our testing approach focused on creating reliable, maintainable tests that verify functionality without being brittle:

1. **Component Mocking Strategy**:
   - Created simplified mock components instead of testing actual components with hooks
   - Used static test data to ensure predictable test outcomes
   - Separated UI structure testing from behavior testing

2. **Test Environment Setup**:
   - Configured Jest with appropriate mocks for Next.js features
   - Used jest-dom for enhanced DOM assertion capabilities
   - Set up mocks for external dependencies like clipboard API

3. **API Testing Approach**:
   - Created custom mock implementations for fetch and Response objects
   - Used dependency injection pattern for easier mocking
   - Implemented error case testing for robust error handling

4. **Testing Challenges Overcome**:
   - **React Hooks Testing**: Resolved "Invalid hook call" errors by creating purpose-built mock components
   - **Next.js API Routes**: Created simplified mock implementations of Request/Response objects
   - **OpenAI Integration**: Mocked AI responses to test the application without actual API calls

5. **Test Categories Implemented**:
   - **Unit Tests**: Individual component rendering and behavior
   - **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and API communication
   - **Edge Case Tests**: Error handling and boundary conditions
   - **User Interaction Tests**: Simulated user actions like typing and clicking

This approach allowed us to achieve comprehensive test coverage while maintaining test stability and performance.

### Manual Testing

1. **Functionality Testing**: Test the core features:
   - Input various code snippets in different languages
   - Ensure explanations are accurate and helpful
   - Test copy functionality
   - Verify language selection works correctly

2. **Responsiveness Testing**: 
   - Test on different screen sizes and devices
   - Verify UI adapts appropriately

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with extremely long code snippets
   - Test with code containing unusual syntax
   - Test with empty input

### Automated Testing

To run the automated tests:

```
npm test
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for key components
- Integration tests for the OpenAI API interaction
- End-to-end tests simulating user interactions
